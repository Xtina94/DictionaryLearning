\section{Reducing the strong community structure in the graph}
\section{Incorporate the structure of an atom}
The large scale approach is still expensive as it learns the whole graph at the same time anyway. So one interesting deepening of this would be finding a way to learn the bigger structure of a graph, without actually learning the small subgraphs. This would permit a user to have a first look to the overall structure the signal has and only after go into details if needed. One approach to this could be hierarchical clustering \cri{citalo}
