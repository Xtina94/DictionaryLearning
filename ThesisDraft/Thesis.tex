\section{Introduction: the emerging field of graph signal processing}
\cri{Forse potresti aggiungere un'introduzione un po' pi√π poetica su come al giorno d'oggi siamo circondati da dati in ogni angolo}\\
One of the central entities we will use in this work is the concept of \textit{graph signal}. Graphs are generic data representation structures, which are useful in a great variety of fields and applications for everyday life and technology in general. These structures are composed by two main elements: the nodes and the edges; the former are a set of points, identifying an aspect of the graph structure itself, while the latter are connections between the nodes. Several structures we can encounter in natural entities and abstract constructions can be represented by a graph structure, and when we associate values to their set of nodes and edges we obtain a graph signal. To be specific, a graph signal is seen as a finite collection of samples located at each node in the structure and which are interconnected among themselves through the edges, to which we can associate numerical values representing the weights of the connections. The metric for these weights is not unique, as it depends on which relation between the nodes we are looking at: a typical metric for graph weights may be, for example, inversely proportional to the distance (physical or not) between two different nodes, but other options are possible.

As previously mentioned, graph structures appear to be significantly helpful when they are used to represent signals, their applications are the most varied and can go from \cri{finisci la frase con degli esempi tratti dai paper}
